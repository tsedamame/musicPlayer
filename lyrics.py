 "Her - Blossom Roses": 
"""The rolling of thunder
Wolves calling each other
As the roses stay covered
In the black of the night
Passions extinguish
In short whispered sentences
Bandaged from memory
As the thought of yesterday
Now I look past my shoulder
For the face of my mother
Did I see her smiling or was it all a dream?
No, I seem to recall
The perfume of roses
The day they are hiding
The dew drops are frozen
Half fool, half blind, half awake girl
Half fool, half blind, half awake world
Half fool, half blind, half awake girl
Half fool, half blind, half awake world
Come on, blossom roses
The wolf is sending messages
Sweet perfume of love
Just under our noses
I warned all my horses
Just leave what's above
Sweet labour of love
Just surrender to the other
Half fool, half blind, half awake girl
Half fool, half blind, half awake world
Half fool, half blind, half awake girl
Half fool, half blind, half awake world
Sweet lover, keep loving
Sweet lover, keep loving
Sweet lover, keep loving
Sweet lover, keep loving
Sweet lover, keep loving
Sweet lover, keep loving
Sweet lover, keep loving
Sweet lover, keep loving
Sweet lover, keep loving
Sweet lover, keep loving
Sweet lover, keep loving
Sweet lover, keep loving
Among sweet hypnosis
I'll never know why it overdoses
The sweet vapour of love
Just like a drug, it discloses
Awakened quiet senses
We write a new synopsis
Sweet liquor of love
You left to drop to discover""",

"""you know I can paint the world
Sitting there in black and gold
You're the perfect chemical
I gotta test, I gotta know
You know I'm no criminal
But I could take your heart and go
You're the perfect chemical
I gotta test, I gotta, gotta
Just let me (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Just let me (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Just let me (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Just let me (uh)
좋은 차, 많은 돈 없을 수 있어 하지만
난 널 아낄 수 있고 또 소중히 다룰 수 있어
그리고 네가 원하면 우주선을 타 밤하늘
건너 별을 따 너의 손에 쥐여줄 수 있어
(Yeah, yeah) 말만 해 뭐든지 뭐 어때?
비 오는 날 커피? Okay
신사 홍대 압구? Okay
아침에 no make up
It's okay, it's okay
I'll be getting it ready to fuse
Sitting on top of the world just cue
Missing a puzzle, I swear it's you (yo)
You know I can paint the world
Sitting there in black and gold
You're the perfect chemical
I gotta test, I gotta know
You know I'm no criminal
But I could take you heart and go
You're the perfect chemical
I gotta test, I gotta, gotta
Just let me (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Just let me (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Just let me (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Just let me (yeah)
If you let me be the code
네가 원하는 색깔별로
하늘도 바다도 산도 함께 칠할 수 있어
If you let me be the code
우리의 많은 다른 점도
선으로 이어갈 수 있어
Take one (hmm)
If your new to this paint the world
We can roll with this black and gold
What to do with this chemical
Know your new to this
If your new to this paint the world
We can roll with this black and gold
What to do with this chemical
I gotta test, I gotta, gotta
Just let me (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Just let me (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Just let me (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Just let me (yeah)
Just let me (mm, mm, I gotta know)
Just let me (mm, mm, I gotta know)
Just let me (mm, mm, I gotta know)
I could be the painter, baby
You could be my (uh)
We could be drunk on that love 'til we pass out
Yeah right here, right now
Yeah 너의 예쁜 허리에 두 손을
Girl, can't we just dance now? Yeah
I could, I could
I could paint your beauty
That's if you
Just let me (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Just let me (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Just let me (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Just let me
Coming to you live
You know I can paint the world
Sitting there in black and gold
You're the perfect chemical
I gotta test, I gotta know
You know I'm no criminal
But I could take you heart and go
You're the perfect chemical
I gotta test, I gotta
